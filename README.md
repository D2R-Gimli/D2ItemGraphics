# D2ItemGraphics
Custom images for items ingame

# Installation
Download the files as zip and extract to your D2/PD2 game path.
You need to extract and edit your UniqueItems.txt from the game files.
If you dont know how, here is a quick guide:
- Use the MPQEditor ([Ladiks_MpqEditor_en_v4.0.0.937](https://github.com/D2R-Gimli/D2_modding_tools/tree/98083edfa7dda69f1ef1cae58bc14479929e4d7a/Ladiks_MpqEditor_en_v4.0.0.937)) and open the Patch_D2.mpq (D2) from gamedir (for PD2 its the ProjectD2/pd2data.mpq)
- Use the Listfile if needed. Navigate to data/global/excel and search for UniqueItems.txt and extract it to your game folder (i.e. ProjectD2/data/global/excel/UniqueItems.txt)
- The UniqueItems.txt file now needs to be edited ([AFJ Sheet Edit 0.61b](https://github.com/D2R-Gimli/D2_modding_tools/tree/98083edfa7dda69f1ef1cae58bc14479929e4d7a/AFJ%20Sheet%20Edit%200.61b))
- Search for the specific item you wanna change and put in the new graphics file name in the column "invfile"
- For use - you need to run your game with "-direct txt" to load up the game and use the extracted files.
